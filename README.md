Professional Self-Assessment 

My experience with the computer science capstone is, it was challenging. It presented many different projects and different tasks at hand to further my skills. I currently have a job in the IT field, doing operations Technology engineering. I review code and procure efficiency on a wide array of different projects. This course helped me get the best grasp on how a large project can push me to my fullest potential on creating programs to debugging a code for various fixes. With that it showcased my many strengths especially in efficiency (who ever sat at their computer and waited and waited) that is never fun. My biggest strive is to get it done quickly and accurately.
All of these artifacts presented within this portfolio all have a way to showcase how well I perform in Structure, efficiency, and detail specific orientation. With those things I can show through a storybook of code my skillset.

Project 1 
I challenged myself on the animal shelter project to demonstrate some skills in software Design/engineering.
The code is a well-structured piece that follows best practices for working with a MongoDB database using the pymongo library. The class AnimalShelter provides methods for all the basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on a MongoDB collection, and the error handling in the methods is a good practice to handle potential issues that may arise during database operations.

Project 2
In the second project I demonstrate my knowledge with Binary search trees (data structure), These search trees are very helpful with information management. The code follows best practices for C++ coding style, such as using header files, using the unique_ptr smart pointer for memory management, and using namespace declarations.
The Bid struct represents the bid information that will be stored in each node of the binary search tree. The struct contains the bidId, title, fund, and amount fields. The Node struct represents a node in the binary search tree. It contains the Bid object and two unique_ptr pointers, one for the left child and one for the right child. Some common uses for a binary search tree include implementing sorting algorithms, searching for values in large datasets, and organizing data in a hierarchical manner.

Project 3
My final piece of my project demonstrates my knowledge in databases. I have presented here a bid program for buying and selling of goods for auction.
It best shows how I was able to speed up the use of the table by using sqlite.
Sqlite is an easy open source and a very lightweight database engine, that is very efficient at querying data to many extents.
